1. How does logistic regression differ from linear regression?
Linear regression predicts continuous values, whereas logistic regression predicts probabilities for categorical outcomes (usually binary).

2. What is the sigmoid function?
A function 
𝜎(𝑥)=1/(1+𝑒−𝑥)
σ(x)=1/(1+e−x) that maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1, used to model probabilities in logistic regression.

3. What is precision vs recall?
Precision: Correct positive predictions ÷ Total predicted positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): Correct positive predictions ÷ Total actual positives.

4. What is the ROC-AUC curve?
A plot of True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate at different thresholds. AUC measures overall model discrimination ability.

5. What is the confusion matrix?
A table showing True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives to evaluate classification performance.

6. What happens if classes are imbalanced?
The model may be biased toward the majority class, leading to poor recall/precision for the minority class. Techniques like resampling or class weighting can help.

7. How do you choose the threshold?
By analyzing precision-recall tradeoff, ROC curve, or business requirements to balance false positives vs false negatives.

8. Can logistic regression be used for multi-class problems?
Yes, using one-vs-rest (OvR) or softmax (multinomial) extension to handle multiple classes.
